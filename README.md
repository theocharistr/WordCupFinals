Based on the wikipedia link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals I edited the
WorldCupFinals.csv which inluded Year,Winners,Score,Runners-up,Venue of the Finals cwith c++ 
to find out which team has the most win in the Fifa world Cup finals. 
I saved the winners of the finals in a new csv "Winners.csv" and using python, I visualized the 
data in a world map.
